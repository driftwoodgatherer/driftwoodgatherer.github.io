# Cuttlefish Bone


<div><img src="/assets/images/cf1_680_x_540.jpg"></div>


## Details


100% natural British cuttlefish bone. 
Varying sizes. This is a natural 
product picked fresh from the beach
so not pristine white. Many pieces
 are slightly broken but most are a good size 
and nearly whole. Typically 10cm-14cm.
 Broken by the stormy sea.

When you receive them you should 
leave them out to dry off completely.

__Your pets will find them delicious!__

### Buy a Big Box
At least 700g. Mostly
 10-14cm range. The number of pieces 
you get depends on the density which
varies throughout the year. 700g is 20-30 pieces. 
I'm often very generous though!
