## Details
These driftwood keyrings make a lovely wedding favour idea for sailers, watersport enthusiasts and lovers of the sea.

Each keyring is made from quality British or
 Irish beach worn driftwood. Lovely to hold 
and look at. Very tactile.
 
Make the wedding favours extra special by sourcing the driftwood  
from either Wales, Ireland, England or Scotland.

I also accept commissions to go to a particular 
location to collect the driftwood if there is,
for example,  a beach of special importance 
to you.
