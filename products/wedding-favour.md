## Details
These driftwood keyrings make a lovely wedding favour idea for watersport enthusiasts and lovers of the sea.

Each keyring is made from quality British or Irish beach worn driftwood. Lovely to hold and look at. Very tactile. These make a lovely gift for campervan, motorhome, boat, caravan, holiday home, beach hut and watersports enthusiasts. 

 The photos are for illustration purposes only. The keyring you will receive will be similar but different as each keyring is unique and vary in shape, size and colour.

Make the wedding favours extra special by sourcing the driftwood  
from either Wales, Ireland, England or Scotland.

I also accept commissions to go to a particular 
location to collect the driftwood if there is,
for example,  a beach of special importance 
to you.
